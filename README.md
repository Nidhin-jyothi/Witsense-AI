# ü§ñ UGV Robotics Project using ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo

This project simulates an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in a 3D environment using ROS 2 (Humble) and Gazebo. It includes multiple ROS packages that handle sensor simulation, UGV modeling, object detection, and navigation.

## üì¶ Packages Included

- `sensor_reading`: Publishes and subscribes to simulated sensor data
- `gazebo_test`: Launches basic simulation world and robot
- `yolobot_gazebo`: Integrates the robot model and sensors into Gazebo
- `yolobot_recognition`: Implements person/object detection using YOLO
- `yolov8_msgs`: Custom message definitions for YOLOv8 inference
